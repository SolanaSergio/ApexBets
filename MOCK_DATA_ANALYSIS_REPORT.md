### **API Routes**
```
app/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ sports/[sport]/              # Sport-specific data
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics/[sport]/           # Sport-specific analytics
â”œâ”€â”€ predictions/[sport]/         # Sport-specific predictions
â”œâ”€â”€ odds/[sport]/               # Sport-specific odds
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ odds-analysis/          # Cross-sport odds analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trend-analysis/         # Cross-sport trend analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prediction-accuracy/    # Cross-sport accuracy
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ player-analytics/       # Cross-sport player data
â””â”€â”€ unified/                    # Unified interface
```

## Sport Support

### **Currently Supported Sports**
- âœ… Basketball (NBA, WNBA, NCAA, EuroLeague)
- âœ… Football (NFL, NCAA, CFL)
- âœ… Baseball (MLB, MiLB, NPB, KBO)
- âœ… Hockey (NHL, AHL, KHL, SHL)
- ðŸ”„ Soccer (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Champions League) - *Service not yet implemented*
- ðŸ”„ Tennis (ATP, WTA, Grand Slams, Masters) - *Service not yet implemented*
- ðŸ”„ Golf (PGA Tour, LPGA, European Tour, Masters, US Open, British Open, PGA Championship) - *Service not yet implemented*

### **Adding New Sports**
To add a new sport:
1. Create sport service in `lib/services/sports/[sport]/`
2. Extend `SportSpecificService` base class
3. Implement required abstract methods
4. Add sport to `ServiceFactory`
5. Create API routes if needed

## Data Flow

### **Component â†’ API â†’ Service â†’ External APIs**
```
Component
    â†“
API Endpoint (/api/analytics/odds-analysis?sport=basketball)
    â†“
SportOddsService (basketball, NBA)
    â†“
External APIs (Odds API, SportsDB, etc.)
    â†“
Database (Supabase)
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### **1. Sport-Agnostic Design**
- All services work with any supported sport
- No hardcoded sport-specific logic in shared components
- Proper sport validation and error handling

### **2. Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to empty arrays instead of mock data

### **3. Caching Strategy**
- **Data Services**: 5 minutes for games, 30 minutes for teams/players
- **Analytics Services**: 15 minutes
- **Prediction Services**: 10 minutes
- **Odds Services**: 2 minutes (live data)

### **4. Rate Limiting**
- Each service has its own rate limiting
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Service-specific API limits respected

## Recommendations

### **1. Immediate Actions**
- âœ… All critical issues have been resolved
- âœ… Service architecture is properly organized
- âœ… API endpoints are complete and functional

### **2. Future Enhancements**
- Consider implementing the remaining sport services (soccer, tennis, golf)
- Add more sophisticated caching strategies
- Implement real-time data updates via WebSockets
- Add more comprehensive error monitoring

### **3. Monitoring**
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Track service health across all sports
- Monitor cache hit rates and performance

## Conclusion

The ApexBets application now has a clean, well-organized service architecture that properly supports multiple sports without hardcoded dependencies. All components use real data from external APIs, and the system is designed to be easily extensible for new sports and features.

**Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY**
