## Conclusion

The ApexBets system has **excellent data access capabilities** with working external APIs providing real, comprehensive sports data across all major sports. The main issue is that the **database population process is not working**, leaving the database empty despite having access to rich data sources.

**Next Steps**: Fix the data population scripts to populate the database with the real data that's already being successfully fetched from external APIs.
